ðŸ§  Employee Attrition Analysis
This project analyzes HR data to identify key drivers of employee attrition using Python and SQL.
The goal is to uncover actionable insights to reduce employee turnover.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

SQL (for querying structured data)

Google Colab (for coding environment)

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

Rows: 1470

Features: 35 (e.g., Age, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, OverTime, Attrition)

âœ… Steps Performed
1. Data Wrangling
Loaded dataset, checked for missing values and duplicates

Verified data types and structure

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored attrition distribution and key categorical features

Examined relationships using cross-tabulation and summary statistics

3. Visualization
Visualized relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib:

Job Satisfaction vs Attrition

Work-Life Balance vs Attrition

Monthly Income vs Attrition

Overtime vs Attrition

4. Insights & Recommendations
ðŸ“Œ Insights
Overtime workers are significantly more likely to leave

Low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance correlate with higher attrition

Employees with lower income have a higher turnover rate

âœ… Recommendations
Limit or compensate overtime to avoid burnout

Improve job satisfaction via regular feedback & recognition

Promote work-life balance through flexible scheduling

Ensure competitive pay, especially for high-turnover roles

ðŸ“‰ Impact
These recommendations, if implemented, could hypothetically reduce attrition by up to 12% based on observed trends.
